# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project focuses on a Movie Recommendation System based on
machine learning and the method of determining the similarity scores between the two
contents in content-based filtering. Using the cosine similarity formula and their relative
score magnitudes, it aids in determining the distance between the two vectors as well as
their angle. In order to create this model, we took two texts into consideration and plotted
them as a graph, from which we displayed the points using only the x-y plane's two
dimensions.
Using a Python shell and a distance between two vector models approach, this model
analyzes the data to more precisely and effectively determine the similarities between the
two texts.
A recommender system, also known as a recommendation engine or
platform, is a type of information filtering system that attempts to forecast the "rating" or
"preference" a user would assign to a certain item. They are mainly applied in commercial
settings. Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas and are
most commonly recognized as playlist generators for video and music services
like Netflix, YouTube and Spotify, product recommenders for services such as Amazon, or
content recommenders for social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.
Popular recommender systems are also available for subjects like restaurants and online
dating. Systems that recommend articles of study, specialists, collaborators, and financial
services have also been developed.
Hotstar and Netflix are popular examples of such companies which use recommendation
engines that provide us suggestions for films and other relevant items based on our prior
searches and viewing history.
Content-based recommenders provide recommendations by comparing representation of
contents describing an item or a product to the representation of the content describing the
interest of the user (User's profile of interest). They are sometimes referred to as content
based filtering. The content-based technique is adopted or considered here for the design of
the recommender system for digital libraries. Content-based technique is suitable in
situations or domains where items are more than users. The Cosine similarity is a measure
of similarity between two vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the
angle between them. The researchers used this method to determine how similar a research
paper is to a user's query or paper that a user has liked in the past. The research papers are
represented as vectors of weights, where each weight indicates the degree of association
between the research papers and the term. It is helpful in implementing the model with
cosine similarity formula and recommend the string similar to the user choice by analyzing
his patterns of writing with that of the stated other given string. When two or more movies of
some different genres come it becomes hard for Sublime Text to understand.

● It gives the results of similar movies related to my applied set of movies.

● It is confined to providing the results with the help of cosine similarity formula and
count vectorizer.

● It provides the output of movies with the help of datasets governed through csv files.

● Not confined to provide advanced hybrid string matching elements solutions and
responses.
